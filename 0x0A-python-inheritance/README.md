# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

This project gives an understanding on the differences between super- and sub-classes while practicing inheritance, definining classes with multiple base classes, and overiding inherited methods and attributes.
